Hi! This is the repo that'll contain the Streamlit app that consumes data from Kafka, sourced from Arduino sensors.

SO: Arduino sensor -> upload data to laptop-> upload to Kafka server at set intervals -> pull data from Kafka via API in Streamlit app, via button or at set intervals while running.

This'll then allow streaming data from the Arduino and its sensors and showing in a cool web app. Tentative data at least the temp/humidity in the room, along with states of the Arduino board. Maybe I'll have red and green lights for good and bad days I'll press.
